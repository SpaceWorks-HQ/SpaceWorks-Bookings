  Space Works Bookings - first-run setup for a local or desktop install (Windows).
  Right-click -> "Run with PowerShell", or run:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1 [--build]
  Needs Docker Desktop (running) and Git for Windows; the setup itself is setup.sh, run
  through Git Bash, so Windows and Linux installs share one questionnaire and one stack.
  For a server, use the curl installer on Linux instead (see README).
