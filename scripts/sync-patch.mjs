// Writes, and these outputs are committed so builds never need the design repo:
//   public/brand/patch/patch.webp        the hero pose, from mascot/original/patch.png (640 px)
//   public/brand/patch/patch-poses.webp  the eight sneeze-loop frames from mascot/original/frames/, side by
//                                        side in order (frame N sits at N/7 of the sheet); CSS plays the idle
//                                        loop (frames 1-4) and the sneeze (frames 5-8) from it
//
// The walk sheets (patch-walk-right.webp and the approved left-facing patch-walk-left.webp) come from
// SpaceWorks-Events public/brand/patch/ unchanged, so they are not rebuilt here.
// Every pixel is the artwork as drawn: frames are placed, never scaled, recoloured, mirrored or redrawn.
